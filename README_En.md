# MOONIGHT

###### MOONOTUS



Nice to meet you! Here is MOONOTUSTUDIO, I'm MOONOTUS.

The name of this project is MOONIGHT, it is a rythmgame that made some innovation.

What may interest you is that I'm planning to make it without any game engine.

You might be puzzled about why would I wanted to do this,'Cause we already had various engines what can greatly simplify the works we do on creating a new game ,like Unity or Unreal.

You are rught.

but,

I don't know.

I think, maybe, this is what that called Romantic.

To tell the truth,this project was born just by accident meanwhile communicating with other rythmgame player on Internet.

After times of balancing, I eventually made a decision to make MOONIGHT a open source, and we chose LGPL-2.1 protocol.

Honestly speaking, open is the result of many reasons, one of those are most important is to prepare for the worst, if oneday, I couldn't continue to insist on it, I wish, somebody, will take the place of mine, make it perfect.
